Learnlink is an academic focused web application designed to facilitate studying with other students with shared academic interests and schedules. Students can register and create a profile specifying their majors, minors, enrolled courses, and availability. With the search functionality, students can find study sessions with people who share similar study habits, course enrollments, and free time, making it easier to find the perfect study partner or group.
