              The Navy Seal copypasta, also sometimes known as Gorilla Warfare
              due to a misspelling of "guerrilla warfare" in its contents, is an
              aggressive but humorous attack paragraph supposedly written by an
              extremely well-trained member of the United States Navy SEALs
              (hence its name) to an unidentified "kiddo", ostensibly whoever
              the copypasta is directed to. Written in a manner similar to a
              non-serious death threat, the copypasta has the author threaten
              the recipient while boasting of their own increasingly absurd or
              unfeasible accomplishments, such as having "over 300 confirmed
              kills" or being able to kill someone "in over seven hundred ways,
              and thats just with my bare hands". This copypasta is often
              reposted as a humorous overreaction to an insult and is thought to
              have originated on the military-themed imageboard OperatorChan,
              although the earliest known usage of the copypasta was on 4chan on
              November 11th, 2010.[4]
